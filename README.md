Scrawl
======

Introduction
------------

Scrawl is a customizable scratch buffer.  You can write anything in it, and
also evaluate it as vimscript.  It is a temporary buffer though, so all
changes in it will be discarded when vim is quit.  This was heavily inspired by
[scratch.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=664), but
it didn't have enough customization options, so I made this.

Installation
------------

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing
[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and then simply
copy and paste:

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle
    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/4Evergreen4/scrawl.git

Any other plugin managers should work fine as well, such as
[vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim).
